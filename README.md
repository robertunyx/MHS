# The UNYX Mental Health System

MHS 1.0 is developing a belief tracking, elimination system.

## Needed
- Some kind of strict requirements list for writing code that would make every piece of a code immediately understandable with minimal to no thought required, given that the elementary pieces are understood.

## App to-do list
- [ ] Add option to add a component to a list
(1. Click on component, get next steps to add it (basically a form should appear, created through javascript)
(2. There will appear an area for a form (above the general spaces area) and then you add something through the form, the form will disappear and the thing will get added to the space. There are some predefined spaces, aka for "My beliefs" which cannot be deleted, but can be hidden, etc.

## App features:
- Option to create, edit, delete user accounts
- Option to add, edit, remove beliefs
- Option to add, edit, remove undefined patterns
- Option to add, edit, remove defined patterns
- Option to add, edit, delete meta (such as a comment or note or remidner) on all elements (beliefs, patterns)
- Option to create, change, remove links / associations between any thing
- Feature: User accounts
- Option to create, edit, remove custom components/elements that can be added with the QuickAdd tool
- Option to click to select types and categories (instead of browsing and scrolling a list, just clicking on a box that says thought or assumption, etc.)
- When dealing with a sentence, and having a selection, it provides options to add metas such as "assumption", and an option to provide a study or logic-tree to something
- Option to add precise, specific definitions for every single word that makes up an entire belief
- Option to list all possible imaginable scenarios to help bring out beliefs and associations, such as listing every possible reason one would eat trash food or drink alcohol and then use those listed imaginary possible events to extract beliefs and associations
- Option to somehow add general problems in our life into a list, as draft versions, and then option to edit them to finalize them and articulate them, and then option to use a Problem Analysis tool to identify what the real problem(s) is/are and to write out alternative ways one can see it could possibly be resolved, to list out variables that play a role, and link up things, to possibly create some sort of flowchart or graph even where one has a good overview of the nature and structure of the problem (hence it would aid solving any problem in general life, especially in the context of relationships)
- Option to specify a context to get more specified tools and elements better fitting the situation (such as context being Relationships or RomanticRelationships)
- Smart suggest, which if detects certain keywords like 'relationship' then suggests adding a context such as "relationship" or "romantic relationship"
- Tools to help identify where in our life we experience and have such and such patterns
- Section for "self-knowledge"
- Place for venting emotions (history and categories added) and getting anything out of one's mind
- Option to choose from common existing beliefs by category (such as "productivity" or "self-discipline")
- Questionnaire to help figure out your values (set of beliefs) and to help identify conflict in one's mind and acknowledge it
- Tool to help identify where you do not admit something, to accept new things.
- The elimination tool should pop up at each stage options to help make sure the person got through the step, hence clicking on some boxes that they agree with that appear to get the next step; or get analogies or examples from us how to think about it; hence if they did not get we'll give them more boxes with ideas to look into the belief
- Each commonly asked question is explained everywhere


## App logic:
If the user chooses the component "Belief" to add, then the user gets prompted and has to:
- Check whether it is a defined belief (in case they already know their exact belief) or a draft (this would become a meta tag)
- If there are any existing related beliefs, patterns or other components, creating a new connection/association link between the belief and the component to create the tree -- everything in the application leads to a belief
- Option to select any to components and create an association/connection link between them.
- Option to link emotions, feelings, thoughts, anything else to a belief.
- Option to break apart a belief and to identify sub-beliefs or beliefs the belief is reliant on (assumptions) and in the meta, if you click on any word, being able to as the first line, see the definition of each specific word and also browse a list of all the other words that word is based on

- In the app, being able to choose any sentence, statement or claim, and firstly give it the meta that one is dealing with a statement or claim, and then its components, such as that X part is an assumption, which consists of all these other assumptions; which all consist of various keywords which all have their own specific definitions.
